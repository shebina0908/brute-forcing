# brute-forcing
This project demonstrates how password brute-force attacks work in a controlled, legal, and educational environment.
The goal is to help students, security beginners, and ethical hackers understand the importance of strong passwords and proper login security.
To do this, the project uses Hydra, a well-known and widely used penetration-testing tool. Hydra can test how a login form reacts when many different username/password combinations are tried. This helps reveal:
Whether a system uses weak or common passwords
Whether a login form has proper security measures (rate limits, lockouts, CAPTCHAs, etc.)
How attackers might attempt to guess passwords — so defenders can learn how to prevent it
This repository does not promote hacking or illegal use. Instead, it provides a safe demonstration of how authentication testing works, focusing on learning, awareness, and improving security.
All examples are performed on legal testing targets that are intentionally made vulnerable for training purposes.
Understanding these techniques is important because it helps developers and security professionals:
Build stronger password requirements
Implement protections like login throttling
Detect and prevent brute-force attempts
Improve overall system security
By studying how brute-force attacks function, we can better protect real systems and user data.
